The tutorial, titled "Introduction to Geospatial Machine Learning," is scheduled for Sunday, 29th October, from 09:00 - 13:00. Participants will gain insights into the geospatial domain using Python libraries and learn the applications of open-source geospatial data. A significant portion will highlight the features of the srai (Spatial Representation for Artificial Intelligence) library developed by our team, along with other libraries like GeoPandas, Shapely, osmnx, and scikit-learn. We're enthusiastic about providing hands-on learning, and as such, tutorial materials will be shared in the form of Jupyter notebooks.
