description: "We're delighted to announce that our submission to the 4th ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Advances on Resilient and Intelligent Cities (ARIC) has been accepted! We'll be presenting a paper on effective geographic transfer learning using OpenStreetMap region features for bike station location predictions."

We'll be presenting on the workshop day, November 2nd at 10:00 AM local time. You can find our paper at the [arxiv website](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00990) and the [conference proceedings](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3486626.3493434). We hope to see you there! Feel free to see the [demo of our solution](https://kraina-ai.github.io/Transfer-learning-approach-to-bicycle-sharing-systems-station-location-planning-using-OpenStreetMap/).

<em>Update:</em> transfer learning approaches have been implemented in our Spatial Representations for Artificial Intelligence library - [SRAI](https://kraina-ai.github.io/srai).
