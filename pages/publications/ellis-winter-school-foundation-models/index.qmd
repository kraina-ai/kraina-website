description: "A poster presentation about the srai library, geospatial representation learning and vision for geospatial foundation model based on OpenStreetMap data. Presented during ELLIS Winter School on Foundation Models in Amsterdam 2024.
It is based on our prior work about transfer learning [[1](https://doi.org/10.1145/3486626.3493434)], representation learning in geospatial domain [[2](https://doi.org/10.1145/3486635.3491076), [3](https://doi.org/10.1145/3557918.3565865), [4](https://doi.org/10.1145/3486640.3491392)] and the SRAI library system paper [[5](https://doi.org/10.1145/3615886.3627740)]."
